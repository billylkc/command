# Installation
I would **NOT RECOMMEND** downloading any executable to your system directly. A better way would be compiling from the source code with your Go environment.

Use the following command at you own risk. It will download the executable to your binary directory

```
cd ~/bin
wget https://github.com/billylkc/command/blob/master/bin/command?raw=true
```

and call it with `command`
